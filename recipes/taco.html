<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Traditional Mexican beef tacos are made with marinated sliced or shredded beef on soft corn tortillas.  Those are great!  But, that’s not what most Americans think of when we think of classic tacos.</p>

<p>Most of us grew up eating ground beef tacos in a crispy corn shell or a soft flour tortilla, with lots of toppings. </p>

<p>That’s the traditional taco we’re making in this recipe.  But, we’re not using a pre-packaged taco seasoning mix.  This recipe uses a flavorful homemade taco seasoning.
